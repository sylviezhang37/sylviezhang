Hi there üëãüèº I'm currently a grad student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science.

I've published [my own iOS and Android app](https://github.com/sylviezhang37/TasksPlanner-App), and  dipped my toes into [AWS cloud projects](https://github.com/sylviezhang37/aws-journal-app). Before transitioning to software engineering, I had 5 years of experience in Strategy & Operations with a focus on Data Analytics using SQL in relational databases.
