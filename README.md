Hi there üëãüèº I'm currently a grad student at the University of Pennsylvania studying Computer Science.

I‚Äôve published [an app available on both iOS and Android](https://github.com/sylviezhang37/TasksPlanner-App), and I‚Äôve dipped my toes into [AWS cloud projects](https://github.com/sylviezhang37/aws-journal-app). Before transitioning to _software engineering_, I had 5 years of experience in _strategy & operations_ with a focus on _data analytics_ using SQL in relational databases to automate processes and drive insights. 

- **Languages**: Java, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, SQL, HTML
- **Technologies**: React / React Native, Expo, Node.js, Postgres, Flutter, Jira
- **Cloud**: AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, IAM, Amplify), Firebase noSQL database
- **Academic Projects**:
